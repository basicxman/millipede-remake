Millipede Remake
================

Overview
--------

I've never programmed a complete game before and I love Atari's Millipede.  The game is rather simple so I decided to recreate it using Gosu and Ruby.

Graphics & Sound
----------------

Attention graphics designers!  I have absolutely no talent for computer graphics, art and sound.  If anybody is experienced with this and would like to help out, please feel free to clone and take a look around in images/.
